- This project has been created to practice and learn more about React.js, feel free to use it as much as you want, but avoid putting compromised data like passwords, bank cards etc, as the data is stored in localStorage.

## What did I need for this project?

- react-circular-progressbar (for the graphics) https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-circular-progressbar
- react-swipleable-list with prop-types (for the interactive menu for editing or deleting your expenses) https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-swipeable-list and https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types
- nanoId (dont require installation)

The application has been initialised with vite through the command **npm init vite@latest**
